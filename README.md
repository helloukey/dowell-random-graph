# Dowell Random Graph

The Dowell Random Graph project generates random points and displays them on a graph. It supports two types of random point generation:

- **Field Random Points**: Generates points randomly within a defined field.
- **Excel Random Points**: Generates points based on data typically found in Excel-like spreadsheets.

The project is built with TypeScript and JavaScript, using React for the frontend. State management and API fetches are handled using the Redux Toolkit. Styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Random Point Generation: Create random points in field and Excel modes.
- Graph Display: Visual representation of generated points on a graph.
- TypeScript Integration: Ensures type safety and code quality.
- Redux Toolkit: Simplified state management and API interactions.
- Tailwind CSS: Efficient and customizable styling.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helloukey/dowell-random-graph.git
cd dowell-random-graph
```

- Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- Run the Application

```bash
npm run start
```

## TypeScript Features

- **Static Typing**: Reduces runtime errors and enhances development efficiency.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Define structures for components and state.
- **Type Inference**: Automatically infers types for better code readability.

## State Management with Redux Toolkit

The project utilizes the Redux Toolkit for state management, replacing the older Redux methodology. The Redux Toolkit offers:

- **Simplified Syntax**: Reduces boilerplate code.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Enhances functionality and development experience.
- **Modern API Fetching**: Uses createAsyncThunk for handling async requests.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

- **Utility-First Framework**: Provides low-level utility classes.
- **Customization**: Easy to customize to match the project design.
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in support for responsive design principles.

## Rechart

- **Beautiful Area Chart** - Generates beautiful area charts using random points list.
